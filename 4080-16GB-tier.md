## Best-of-the-Best Local AI Models for RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)

---

### Large Language Models (Text Generation)

| Model Name | Recommended Variant/Quantization (for 16GB VRAM) | Ideal Usage Scenario | Comments |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Llama 3 8B Instruct** | `8B` (**Q4_K_M** or **Q5_K_M**) | General Chat, Reasoning, Instruction Following | **Highly recommended** for general use. Offers excellent performance and strong reasoning for its size, running very fast with full GPU acceleration. |
| **Mistral 7B Instruct** | `7B` (**Q4_K_M** or **Q5_K_M**) | General Chat, Summarization, Code Snippets | Very efficient and capable. Provides a great balance of performance and size, making it an excellent all-rounder for various tasks. |
| **DeepSeek-Coder 7B Instruct** | `7B` (**Q4_K_M** or **Q5_K_M**) | Programming, Code Generation, General Reasoning | A surprisingly strong general-purpose model with exceptional coding abilities. The 7B version runs very quickly and is highly effective for developer-centric tasks. |
| **Qwen2 7B Instruct** | `7B` (**Q4_K_M** or **Q5_K_M**) | General Chat, Multilingual Tasks, Reasoning | Offers strong performance and robust multilingual support, making it versatile for diverse communication and reasoning needs. |
| **Phi-3-Mini** | `3.8B` (**Q4_K_M**) | Quick Responses, Coding, Light Reasoning | Extremely small and fast, yet surprisingly capable for its size. Ideal for rapid interactions and efficient coding assistance; runs almost instantly. |
| **Code Llama 13B Instruct** | `13B` (**Q4_K_M**) | Advanced Code Generation, Debugging | A strong dedicated coding model for more complex programming tasks. The 13B variant will fit well within 16GB VRAM, providing good performance for coding workflows. |
| **LLaVA 1.6 7B** | `7B` (**Q4_K_M**) | Image Understanding, Visual Question Answering | **Multimodal.** Uniquely allows interaction with images (e.g., "Describe this image," "What's happening here?"). Runs well, but requires a compatible frontend (like Ollama with LLaVA support). |
| **DeepSeek-Coder 33B Instruct** | `33B` (**Q3_K_M**) | Advanced Programming, Complex Reasoning | **Tight fit.** To run fully on 16GB VRAM, a lower quantization like `Q3_K_M` is often necessary, which can lead to a slight reduction in output quality. Larger contexts may still result in some layers offloading to CPU RAM, impacting speed. Offers more sophisticated coding capabilities than smaller models. |
| **Qwen2 32B Instruct** | `32B` (**Q3_K_M**) | Complex Chat, Detailed Reasoning, Multilingual | **Tight fit.** Similar to DeepSeek-Coder 33B, this model typically requires `Q3_K_M` quantization to fit into 16GB VRAM. Expect potential minor quality trade-offs and possible CPU offloading for longer interactions. Provides a significant leap in capability over 7B/13B models. |

### Generative Image Models

| Model Name | Recommended Variant/Quantization (for 16GB VRAM) | Ideal Usage Scenario | Comments |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** | `Base` (Optimized, often **Q4_K_M**) | High-quality image generation, photorealism, artistic styles | The industry standard for high-quality image generation. Runs well on 16GB VRAM, typically requiring around 12-14GB for the base model and refiner. |
| **FLUX.1 Schnell/Dev** | `Schnell FP8` (for efficiency), `Dev` (for research) | Fast image generation, commercial applications | Optimized for lower VRAM usage and noted for its fast generation. The `Schnell` variant is great for general use, while `Dev` might push the 16GB limit for full features. |

### Generative Video Models

| Model Name | Recommended Variant/Quantization (for 16GB VRAM) | Ideal Usage Scenario | Comments |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LTX Video** | `13B` (Optimized/Quantized, e.g., **GGUF**) | Fast text-to-video, image-to-video, short clips | Highly optimized for consumer GPUs, capable of very fast generation times (e.g., 5 seconds of 24 FPS video in 4 seconds). |
| **WAN 2.1** | `14B` (**GGUF**, **Q4_K_M** or **Q3_K_M**) | Text-to-video, image-to-video, various resolutions | Can run efficiently on 16GB VRAM with its lower VRAM variants (e.g., ~8GB for base, optimized versions). Offers diverse resolution options. |

### Generative Audio Models

| Model Name | Recommended Variant/Quantization (for 16GB VRAM) | Ideal Usage Scenario | Comments |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MAGNET (Meta)** | (Standard local release, often optimized) | High-quality music/audio synthesis from text/prompts | Described as the "Stable Diffusion" for audio. Specifically noted to be runnable on 16GB GPUs, making it a strong local option. |
| **Whisper.cpp** | `large-v3` (Optimized/Quantized) | Speech-to-Text, Transcription | A highly accurate, C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper model. Runs efficiently on GPU, enabling fast and private audio transcription locally. |

### General Tips for 4080 Super:

* **Prioritize Q4_K_M quantization:** This generally offers the best balance of speed, quality, and VRAM usage for most models on your card. For 30B+ models, `Q3_K_M` will likely be required.
