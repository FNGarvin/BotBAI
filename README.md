# Best-of-the-Best Local AI Model Recommendations by GPU VRAM

This repository represents an attempt to provide curated, opinionated lists of "Best-of-the-Best" local AI models optimized for various GPU Video RAM (VRAM) tiers. Each list details recommended models for a specific VRAM capacity, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Image Analysis models, Generative Image models, Generative Video models, and Generative Audio models.

The goal is to help you understand what's realistically achievable with your GPU and to guide you in selecting models that balance performance, quality, and VRAM efficiency for local inference - at least as of today.  Given the fast-moving nature of the tech, that's the best we can do.  But the general guidelines and selection reasoning (specifically in choosing which sacrifices to make wrt precision modes, quantization nodes, and parameter size) should have some lasting value.

## General Expectations Across VRAM Tiers

The amount of VRAM your GPU possesses is arguably the most critical factor for running modern AI models locally. It dictates which models can fit into memory, the precision they can run at, the context window length for LLMs, and the resolution/complexity for generative image/video models.

### 4GB GPU: The Frontier Explorer

* **Performance & Ability:** This tier is the extreme edge for modern AI tasks. You'll primarily be limited to very small Large Language Models (LLMs) and basic image analysis. Generative image models are highly experimental, often producing low-resolution, artifact-prone outputs at very slow speeds. Generative video is largely impractical.
* **Ease-of-Use & Codebases:** Expect to be a "trailblazer." Community support for highly constrained setups is limited, meaning you'll spend significant time experimenting, troubleshooting, and perhaps even modifying configurations to get models to run. Many models and tools are not designed for this VRAM level, requiring aggressive quantization and clever workarounds.
* **Key Challenge:** Memory constraints are paramount. Frequent CPU offloading will bottleneck performance, and the quality degradation from aggressive quantization (e.g., `Q2_K`, `Q3_K_M`) will be noticeable across modalities.

### 8GB GPU: The Enthusiast's Entry Point

* **Performance & Ability:** This is where local AI starts to become genuinely usable for many. You can comfortably run efficient 7B-class LLMs (like Mistral) with good quality. Image generation becomes feasible, though still often limited to lower resolutions and requiring optimization. Video generation remains challenging, but very short, low-fidelity clips might be possible.
* **Ease-of-Use & Codebases:** You'll find a much broader range of pre-quantized models available (e.g., `Q4_K_M`). Tools like Ollama and `llama.cpp` offer good support. While some tweaking might still be necessary, the struggle to get operational is significantly reduced compared to 4GB.
* **Key Challenge:** Balancing quality with VRAM usage remains crucial. You'll often be choosing between higher quality (larger quantizations) or longer context windows, as you can rarely have both simultaneously.

### 16GB GPU: The Balanced Sweet Spot

* **Performance & Ability:** This VRAM tier hits a great balance. You can comfortably run leading 7B/8B LLMs (like Llama 3 8B) at higher quality (e.g., `Q5_K_M`). Many 13B models become very usable, and you can even experiment with 30B+ models with more aggressive quantization (`Q3_K_M`). High-quality image generation (SDXL) is fully viable, and video generation becomes genuinely accessible for short clips.
* **Ease-of-Use & Codebases:** This is a well-supported tier in the local AI community. Many models are readily available in suitable quantizations. Most popular AI UIs and frameworks will work smoothly, and there's ample community support for common issues.
* **Key Advantage:** Significant flexibility to choose between larger, more capable models at reasonable quality or smaller models at higher precision for maximum speed. It's often considered the "sweet spot" for performance per dollar spent in consumer hardware.

### 24GB GPU: The Performance Enthusiast

* **Performance & Ability:** This tier unlocks high-end local AI experiences. You can run powerful MoE models like Mixtral 8x7B with excellent quality. Experimenting with 70B+ LLMs at usable quality (`Q4_K_M`) becomes feasible, though still pushing limits. High-resolution image generation, complex ControlNet workflows, and longer, higher-quality video clips are within reach. Many models can run at higher precision (`fp16` or `Q6_K`), leading to improved output quality and faster inference.
* **Ease-of-Use & Codebases:** The vast majority of open-source models and frameworks are designed with this VRAM class in mind, ensuring a smooth experience. You'll encounter fewer out-of-memory errors and faster iteration times.
* **Key Advantage:** A significant leap in capability and quality, offering the best local experience for the price before moving into professional-grade hardware. It provides ample VRAM for complex multi-modal workflows and higher-fidelity outputs.

## Purchasing Perspective: The Sweet Spot and Value Scaling

From a **purchasing perspective**, the **16GB GPU tier (e.g., RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, RTX 4070 Ti SUPER)** often represents the **"sweet spot" for value**. Here's why:

* **Broad Capability:** It strikes an excellent balance, enabling a wide array of modern AI tasks without the prohibitive cost of top-tier cards. You can run most popular open-source models at a very usable quality and speed.
* **Community Support:** This VRAM level has a large user base, meaning models are actively optimized for it, and you'll find ample community support for troubleshooting.
* **Price-to-Performance:** The incremental cost to go from 8GB to 16GB often yields a disproportionately large leap in practical AI capabilities, making it a very efficient upgrade.

Regarding **value scaling throughout the ranges**:

* **Diminishing Returns Below 8GB:** Below 8GB (especially at 4GB), you face significant diminishing returns. Each dollar spent on VRAM at these lower tiers yields less practical AI capability, and you encounter more frustration with performance and quality limitations. The "cost" isn't just financial; it's also in time spent troubleshooting and managing expectations.
* **Near-Linear to 16GB:** The jump from 8GB to 16GB offers close to linear, or even *super-linear*, value scaling in terms of expanded model choice, improved quality, and reduced friction.
* **Diminishing Returns Above 24GB (for consumers):** While higher VRAM (e.g., 32GB, 48GB, or more) offers undeniable advantages, for the average consumer, the **price-to-performance ratio starts to diminish** rapidly after 24GB. You enter the realm of professional-grade cards (RTX 3090/4090, or even enterprise GPUs), where the cost increase is substantial, but the *incremental utility for common personal AI tasks* might not scale linearly with the investment. These higher tiers are more about pushing boundaries, research, or specific high-throughput production workloads.

## Local vs. Cloud-Based Alternatives

The decision to process AI locally versus using cloud-based alternatives (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Cloud AI) involves several trade-offs:

| Feature | Local Processing (with capable GPU) | Cloud-Based Alternatives (APIs) |
| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Privacy** | Your data stays entirely on your machine. | Data is sent to external servers, subject to their privacy policies. |
| **Cost** | High upfront hardware cost; low ongoing electricity cost. | Low upfront cost; pay-per-use (can scale up quickly with usage). |
| **Speed/Latency** | Very low latency for inference once loaded. | Network latency inherent in API calls. |
| **Control** | Full control over models, software, and customization. | Limited control; dependent on provider's offerings and updates. |
| **Offline Use** | Works entirely offline. | Requires internet connection. |
| **Accessibility** | Requires technical setup and hardware investment. | Easy access, often just an API key and code. |
| **Model Size** | Limited by your GPU's VRAM. | Access to models far larger than any consumer GPU can run (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus). |
| **Maintenance** | You manage updates, drivers, dependencies. | Provider handles all infrastructure maintenance. |

**When to abandon local processing for cloud-based alternatives:**

* **Need for Cutting-Edge Performance:** If you consistently need the absolute best models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus) or models larger than 70-80B parameters, cloud APIs are your only practical option.
* **Intermittent or Low Usage:** If you only use AI occasionally or for very short bursts, the pay-per-use model of cloud APIs can be significantly more cost-effective than investing in powerful local hardware.
* **Ease of Use & Development Speed:** For many developers, integrating a simple API call is much faster than setting up and optimizing local inference stacks.
* **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Cloud APIs allow you to access AI from any device with an internet connection, without worrying about local hardware specs.
* **Scalability:** For large-scale applications or high-throughput needs, cloud infrastructure scales much more easily than a single local GPU.

Ultimately, local AI is a powerful choice for those prioritizing privacy, fine-grained control, hobbyist exploration, and consistent, no-cost usage *after* the initial hardware investment. However, for pushing the absolute boundaries of AI capability, occasional use, or rapid development/deployment without hardware concerns, cloud alternatives remain superior. Many users find a hybrid approach most effective, using local models for common tasks and cloud APIs for more demanding or experimental needs.
