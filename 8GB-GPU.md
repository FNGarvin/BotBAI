### Generative Image Models

**Note:** Generating high-quality images on 8GB VRAM can be challenging. Expect limitations in resolution, batch size, and generation speed compared to GPUs with more VRAM.

| Model Name | Recommended Variant/Quantization (for 8GB VRAM) | Ideal Usage Scenario | Comments |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** ✨ | `Base` (Optimized **Q4_K_M** with **LCM/Turbo LoRA**) | Fast image generation at lower resolutions, artistic styles | ✨ The industry standard. On 8GB, use **highly optimized variants** (e.g., `LCM` or `Turbo` LoRAs) and keep resolutions to `512x512` or `768x768` to enable feasible generation. Expect **slower speeds and potential visual artifacts** at higher resolutions. |
| **FLUX.1 Schnell** ✨ | `Schnell FP8` (if available) | Fast image generation, quick artistic concepts | ✨ Optimized for speed and lower VRAM usage. If an `FP8` variant is available, it offers a strong option for relatively fast image generation on 8GB GPUs, especially for rapid concepting. |
